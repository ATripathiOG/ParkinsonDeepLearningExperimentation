# ParkinsonDeepLearningExperimentation

# Welcome to the Github repository.  In this repository, a Jupyter notebook containing the deep learning program can be found.
# In addition, the code is in a .py format for those willing to experiment with it.
# Lastly, there is a copy of the raw data used to train and evaluate the deep learning model.

# If running the model returns an ERROR for the dataset, it may be necessary to repaste the link of the parkinsons.csv data.  The token may have expired.
# To do that, click on the parkinsons.csv file and click "raw." Then, paste the raw Github link to the spot of the link in the model.
# Please reach out with any questions.  Feedback is appreciated.
